# DSR Team Managing Tool:

This tool is a tool developed by students at VIA University College at campus
Horsens for its own campus Student Council. The student council will hereafter
be referred to as DSR, the acronym for its original name in Danish.

The aim of this application is to ease the burden of handling membership and
volunteering for the Events Committee specifically, but having in mind the rest
of the committees.

If you are a user, please refer to the usage manual instead. If you are a
developer, read carefully the following paragraphs. These will explain the
design philosophy behind this project, how to maintain it and other important
matters that should be considered before working on this project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This application is made *by* students, *for* students. Thus, it should stick to
the technologies taught at VIA, to make future maintenance easier.

This also means that your code should be as readable as possible, please read
thoroughly the style guide for this project. This allows us all to have the same
naming scheme which will keep the code consistent and easier to read for future
maintainers.

Keep future maintainers in mind at all times. Think about documentation (
Javadoc, use cases, UML diagrams, user manual, style guide, etc...) and keep it
up to date. This helps immensely.

This application includes its own git repository. Read through the git rules and
stick to them, this way, changes are traceable and descriptive, again making
maintaining this application in the future MUCH easier.
