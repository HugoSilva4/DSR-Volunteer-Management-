1. Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed on your system
2. Open terminal
3. Change directory where the DatabaseEFC project lies (so that in it is the Program.cs file)
4. If you don't have a dbconnection.json file in the DatabaseEFC directory already, create one.
It's a JSON file with necessary information to create and execute queries on the database.
The default file looks like this:
{"Username":"postgres","Password":"postgres","Host":"localhost","Database": "postgres","Schema": "public"}

5. Change username and password in the JSON file to your desired postgres user's credentials
6. Change host to your desired destination host (recommended localhost)
7. Change database to your desired database (must exist on your PostgreSQL server beforehand!)
8. Change schema to your desired schema to use

9. In the terminal run this command (remember, must be in DatabaseEFC directory!):
dotnet ef database update
