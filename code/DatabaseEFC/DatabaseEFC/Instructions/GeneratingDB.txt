If you modify the database then you need to also generate a migration for the changes to take effect.

The migration is generated as such:
dotnet ef migrations add <CommitMessage>

The commit message is just like in Git to inform what changes were made in the database.
After that follow the PostgreSQL_DB instructions to generate/update the database on your machine.
